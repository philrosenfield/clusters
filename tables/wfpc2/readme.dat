Get HST Datasets to download!

1. On discovery portal, narrow by SFH filters and radius
   a. download full data table (all columns, including s_region)
3. Use clusters.footprints.crossmatch with literature table (if not Bica2008, check hard coded column names)
4. Use tradec.sh to cull matched csv to target, ra, dec to upload to hst search (which will return Datasets).
5. tradec.sh result has multiple entries (for each pointing/filter). Use uniqify.py to make a culled file (could only do this at step 8, but this way is nicer for ST resources).
6. Upload the *_uniqra.csv file to http://archive.stsci.edu/hst/search.php?form=fuf
7. Download the file, grep for any Warnings (typically, header row or RA being Dataset see tradec.sh)
   a. remove Input lines from file with rmInputline.sh
   b. uniqify by Dataset (uniqify.py -c Dataset)
8. Cut *unique_Dataset.csv to first column with cut_by_dataset.sh
9. Upload step 8 result file or paste its contents into http://archive.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/dataset_lookup
