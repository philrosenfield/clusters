There is some junk in this directory, saved because there is no simple way to redo the search and dl procedures.

NOT JUNK:
mast_fls_uniq.csv  As of 03/02/2016 these are the data sets downloaded matched with MAST tables.
acs_dls.dat Missing ACS datasets submitted to DADS 03/02/2016
wfc3_dls.dat WFC3 datasets to DL with new calibration from ST.

Varying degrees of JUNK:

Used to make acs_dls.dat and wfc3_dls.dat
MAST_lmc_moremoremore.csv
MAST_smc_moremoremore.csv

Used to cross match with mast.csv, mast_fls_uniq.csv, mast_fls.csv (don't worry if its missing stuff, not all headers are read in make_table.py)
all_dled.csv

A huge file that combined make_table.py with MAST tables some time ago. Forgot how I did it.
mast.csv

A slightly culled version of mast.csv to only include files *fl{t,c}.fits
mast_fls.csv

Older tables made by make_table.py that I don't feel like removing right now.
added_all.csv
clusters_acs.csv
lmc_fields_acs.csv
smc_fields_acs.csv
